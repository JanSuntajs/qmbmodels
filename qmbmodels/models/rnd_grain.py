"""
This module contains tools for construction
of the model simulating an ergodic grain coupled
to (localized) LIOMs (local integrals of motion).
The model is inspired by the one used in the
following paper:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10807

The model is as follows:

H = R + \\sum_{i=L_b + 1}^{L_b + L_loc} g0*alpha^{x_i} * S^x_{j_i} * S^x_i + 
    \\sum_{i=L_b + 1}^{L_b + L_loc} h_i * S^z_i


Where L_b is the length of the chain modeled by an ergodic grain
and L_loc is the length of the localized part, the full length L
thus being equal to L = L_b + L_loc. In python's notation, we place
the grain between the zeroth and (L_b - 1)-th site, including both
ends. We do not allow for periodic boundary conditions in this model.

Where R is a symmetric random matrix defined as

    R = (beta/2) * (A + A.T)

With matrix elements A_{ij} being distributed normally with a zero
mean and unit variance.

The second term models the coupling of the grain to the LIOMs, where
    
    alpha = exp(-1./xi),

with xi being the LIOM's localization length and g0 controls the interaction
strength. Note the parameter x_i in the exponent of alpha, which denotes
the distance of the i-th LIOM from the bath. We have devised this model
essentialy as a 0-d model, since the LIOMs do not interact with each other.
To achieve the most generic behavior for such a toy model of the MBL transition
in 0-d, we sample the lengths x_i according to some probability distribution,
in this case, the uniform one on the interval between 1 (we fix the minimum distance
to the grain) and L_loc.

The operator S^x_{j_i} is a bath operator, where the subscript
i_j denotes a randomly chosen site within the bath to which the i-th LIOM
couples.

The last term models the random fields acting on the LIOMs in the localized part.

Further implementations of the model might include setups with the grain being
immersed into surounding localized regions to see whether any additional scaling
factors emerge in the finite size scaling analysis as a consequence of two borders.
